Discription:
The files in this repository are sources codes and supporting data for the Advanced Project: FPGA-Based Artificial Neural Network
for Prediction Temperature from History Climate Records. 

The project is to design a temperature forecast model with an ANN on an FPGA. It should have the ability to predict the highest and
lowest temperature of a specific area at an assigned date based on temperature of previous days. The ANN model has been built on an FPGA
simulator(Modelsim) then trained by 1000 days of historical temperature data to get learned network. The project is written in Verilog and
without auto-generated codes. It includes training and predicting functions, so the process of training and predicting can be done with 
Modelsim.

The neural network is MLP design with 3 layers. It has only one node in output layer which is the predicted temperature, 4 nodes in input
layer for provides 4 previous days temperature of the predicted day, one hidden layer with 8 nodes for intermediary calculating.

The project can only work with Modelsim currently. It's uncompatible with real FPGA now.
