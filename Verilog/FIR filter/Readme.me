Description:
The project defines a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. It has 5 coef_registers for saving the value of coefficients, and 4 stage 
registers for saving shifted sample values. 

When Coef_Load_Ena==1, the filter starts to read the filter. When FIR_Filter_Ena==1, the filter starts to output the result.
