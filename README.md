It includes some codes when I studied computer engineering. Everyone can read, learn, download, share and modify the copies. Hopefully, they can bring inspiration for your designs.

There is NO guarantee that the codes are functioning right or can attain expected goals.

If you are studying related courses, DO NOT read and use these codes in your assignments. Otherwise, it may cause you PLAGIARISM.

If you don't know what causes plagiarism, please ask your instructors before your move. I am not responsible for any causes of plagiarism.

Once you start to explore my code, it indicates you have read and agreed with the above rules.

If you are a lecturer and find that some codes of the repository are the solutions of your assignments, please contact to me. I will modify or remove these codes. Email:xiuzi2009.jl@gmail.com
