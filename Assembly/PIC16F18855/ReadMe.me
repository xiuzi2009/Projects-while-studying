Chip: Microchip PIC16F18855


Description:
It's a small code used for testing the communication part and the function of A/D converter.
The microprocess should read the voltage value from a circuit with photoresistor, then control the ON/OFF of a LED. 
When the photoresistor is established in a dark environment, the LED should be turned on. On the contract, it should be turned off.
